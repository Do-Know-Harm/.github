Do Know Harm is an upcoming visual novel created by a team of student developers for UCLA's ACM Studio, now releasing as a full free game in late 2022.

Set in the midst of a world engulfed in global warfare, two combat medics find themselves caught in an hellfire that only grows larger. Not only will they save those burned by the flames of war, they must eventually turn to face the ashes of their own past.

Every second counts. Every life is in your hands.
